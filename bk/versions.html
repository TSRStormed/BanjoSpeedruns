    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <li><a href="https://bit.ly/2Y9o48x" target="_blank">This document</a> details the differences in the Xbox release of Banjo-Kazooie.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="section">Main Differences</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li><b>Framerate</b><br>
            <p>PAL runs at 25 FPS, NTSC at 30 FPS.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Languages</b><br>
            <p>You can choose language on PAL, it's english only on NTSC-U. So it's faster to reset on NTSC after MMM. On PAL, german have the shortest texts, and french the longest texts (basically around 1s difference in spiral mountain) On NTSC-J, it's
                japanese only, which make the texts slower than other versions.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Level Cutscenes</b><br>
            <p>The cutscene when you open levels is faster on NTSC.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>First Backflip</b><br>
            <p>The first backflip in spiral mountain is very hard on PAL, You have to go behind the corner of the wall to attempt it.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Swimming</b><br>
            <p>Swimming is faster on PAL. But turning underwater is faster on NTSC.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Flying</b><br>
            <p>You turn faster when you fly (with kazooie or with the bee) on NTSC.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Enemy Speed</b><br>
            <p>Enemies are slower on PAL. For example on NTSC: after MMM you can't make a straight line to the gate because ripper goes faster, Or after underwater honeycomb in TTC snacker can be more annoying
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Juju</b><br>
            <p>Juju spins faster on NTSC.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>GV Lobby shockpad</b><br>
            <p>The shockpad in gobi's valley lobby goes faster around the vase on NTSC.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>TTC Early</b><br>
            <p>Clipping through the cannon for TTC early is easier on PAL. The setup on NTSC is very consistent, but you can yolo it on PAL and still clip.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Gobi Clip</b><br>
            <p>Gobi clip (to go inside jinxy) is easier on PAL. Rat-a-tat-rap on the black line on PAL. Be stuck in talon trot on the black line on NTSC. You can also do the beak barge strat on both version (which is very hard). You can do gobi clip the
                NTSC way on PAL with the boots.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>FP Lobby OoB</b><br>
            <p>The clip to do FP early/450 skip/350 skip is easier on PAL.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>CCW softlock backup</b><br>
            <p>The CCW flower softlock backup is different on PAL, because beakbarges are longer.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>RBA</b><br>
            <p>On NTSC you clip through the 765 note door. On PAL, a bit harder, you clip through the top right of the right tree (or top left of the left tree). On all versions of the game, you can also use the Cauldron in the room to stop the detransformation by playing a cutscene which allows
                you to RBA by entering the Cauldron. This is incredibly slow to setup and perform. However, another method that works on all versions and is as fast as 765 Note Door Clip, Brentilda's Out of Bounds (BOoB), is done by clipping into Brentilda by falling 
                quickly onto her hitbox from the top of the room. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Bee clips</b><br>
            <p>Most of the bee clips are harder on PAL. The clip in spring to go in the room at the top of the tree in CCW with bee is very precise on PAL The clip to go in engine room in RBB with the bee is harder on PAL BGS early with bee is less easy
                on PAL
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>RBB window clips</b><br>
            <p>Window clips in RBB with the bee are easier on PAL.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>DoG skip</b><br>
            <p>DoG skip is less hard on PAL.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p class="section">Smaller Differences</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li><b>Demo cutscenes</b><br>
            <p>The demo cutscenes before entering in the file menu are different.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>File 1 lag</b><br>
            <p>Entering in file 1 on NTSC is laggy and 0.5s slower than files 2 and 3. There is no difference here on PAL.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Lag</b><br>
            <p>NTSC is most of the time more laggy than PAL on laggy places.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>First fade-out</b><br>
            <p>To time runs exactly: the first frame of the cutscene (just after the fadeoute when you enter in a new file) is at 3.94 on NTSC (add 0.5 for file 1) and at 4.02 on PAL.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Text</b><br>
            <p>Text scrolls faster on NTSC.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Beakbomb</b><br>
            <p>You beak bomb slightly higher and for a longer distance on NTSC.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Beakbarge</b><br>
            <p>Beakbarge is slightly longer on PAL.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Hourglass Timer</b><br>
            <p>The timer can be slightly different on both version. For example, it's impossible to enter the church in MMM with 5 on the timer on NTSC, but it is possible on PAL. On the contrary, it's impossible to get a 51 tumblar on PAL.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p class="section">NTSC Only</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li><b>Flutter cancel on flat ground</b><br>
            <p>Flutter cancels are faster on NTSC. You can't flutter on PAL pressing A twice quickly on flatground. The way to save time in PAL is to flutter before touching the ground after a jump.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>GV OoB</b><br>
            <p>To go out of bounds in gobi's valley with the bee, you can clip through the tip above the door on both versions (the door to get the stop 'n' swop egg, where gobi gives you the honeycomb). But you can't clip through the door on PAL (under
                the tip).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>MMM Well OoB</b><br>
            <p>You can't go out of bounds in the well in Mad Monster Mansion on PAL.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p class="section">NTSC 1.1 Only</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li><b>Termite skip patch</b><br>
            <p>Termite skip is patched on NTSC-U 1.1 and NTSC-J (or TAS only). You need the termite transformation to climb tickers tower, so 5 more tokens.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Mr Vile instakill</b><br>
            <p>On the extra rounds (to get extra lives), Mr Vile takes away all your health and send you back to the beginning of the level, but you don't have to recollect the notes.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p class="section">PAL Only</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li><b>CC OoB</b><br>
            <p>Going out of bounds in Clanker's Cavern, clipping behind the slope (which makes you go to the alcoves) in PAL only (afaik).</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>FF OoB</b><br>
            <p>Going out of bounds in FP is very very harder on NTSC, by beak bombing through the blue present with honeyhive on.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Crypt water switch</b><br>
            <p>In the crypt after MMM, you can push the water level switch and destroy the coffin with 1 same ground pound sometimes on PAL.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Navigation room with bee</b><br>
            <p>Window clip to navigation room with the bee only works on PAL. You can use grimlet clip to go in this room on NTSC.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>TAS stuff</b><br>
            <p>MMM early, CCW early and 810 skip are PAL and TAS only.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
